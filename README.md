Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was
the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The gaming room is the client who serves as a mobile app creator. They are implementing a game called Draw It or Lost It for Android. The aim of the gaming room trying a new design is to expand to numerous platforms and to upgrade their software functionality to enable them to have a web-based version.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I wrote clearly and concisely explaining why a cloud platform was the perfect choice to be used by the client and serve their purpose. I also wrote an extensive recommendation piece stating important areas for the client’s contemplation. This includes solutions on memory and storage management on the host servers, the host operating system, API framework, and the advantages of launching the product using server-less architecture.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

What proved beneficial in comprehending the relationship and structure between setups representing parts of the app was examining the domain model shown as a UML class diagram. This also aided in developing clear classes with simple ways that straightforwardly leveraged other entities to make a clear prototype.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In the evaluation section, what proved challenging was trying to differentiate between common OSs and mobile platforms. This could be improved greatly on the variation on the client's side between the platforms. Looking into the problem between OSs for web-based solutions brought limiting results.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I aided in splitting the game's functionality to enable one spend less time and do less work while expanding to other operating systems without altering the game. Although the client expects you to put in the work, the end users are the brand users. If the users mistrust the product or don't believe in the software, they won't attempt to use it, which leads to the decline of the product.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I decided to center my attention on comprehensible documentation and separating game which needs to permit easier and simpler updates and maintenance. In designing software, I’d start shallowly and work towards preciseness. In the future, I’d take top tier objectives and work them through different loops to turn them into the best final solution. For instance, in order to meet a client’s objectives, those objectives need to be broken down into practical necessities stating the key pieces of functionality needed. Those functional requirements after being broken down to technical requirements, can trace the steps to functional fulfillment.
